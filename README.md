# PinboardAddExtension

This extension adds automatically to pinboard any site you open. To help you find them, it appends date as a tag. 

YOu must add this as a developer extension.

It is not exactly user-friendly as you need some basic understanding of javascript to change your auth token and make adjustments to the tags, oif you wish.
